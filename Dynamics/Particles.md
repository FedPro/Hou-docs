## 🌍 Interaction & Collisions

- [🧱 Reacting to Surfaces](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/dopparticles/react.html)  
  Have particles bounce, slide, or interact with geometry.

- [💥 Collisions](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/dopparticles/collisions.html)  
  Set up particle collisions with objects in the scene.
